It was fun while it lasted and we did get some cash from it.
Prison Life is just dead now so yeah no more updating shit.
You can go modify this code or do whatever you want but the chances of it working is very low (like very very low)

You can use this source for you own good but like 90% of the source is not even working now
50% of the source is not even here because all of it is broken, outdated or patched either by the version, roblox or aesthetical (he recntly patched everything and added a anticheat lol so yes)

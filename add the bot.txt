To format muitple cookies, I have list an example below.

``config = {
    "Cookies": [
        "Cookie1",
        "Cookie2",
        "Cookie3"
    ]
}``

The last line should not incude a comma (,) at the end of the line otherwise it will result in a syntax error

After this change the Bot variable to the amount of bots you want! (The max amount is how many cookies you provided)
